# shellcode
Wrote a shellcode in assembly language first then converted to hexadecimal code that when executed in UNIX systems will use the system call /bin/sh to launch an interactive shell.
Exploited buffer overflow in a vulnerable c program and set the return address to point to the stack which contains the shellcode.
Used a vulnerable program on a Linux server and got a remote shell on the server.
